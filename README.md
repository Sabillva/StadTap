1️⃣ User Flow:

Users register and log in.

They search for available stadiums.

If their preferred time is booked, they receive an email notification when it becomes free.

They can chat with teams or players in real time.

Stadium owners or users can create and manage tournaments.

Social media features allow posting updates and engaging with others.


📬 Notification Service

The Notification Service uses Celery and Redis. It automatically sends an email when a previously booked stadium slot becomes available.

How it works:

A user attempts to book a stadium at 14:00, but it’s unavailable.

The system queues a notification for that time slot.

If the slot is freed, Celery triggers an email notification.

The user gets an email informing them that the slot is now available.
